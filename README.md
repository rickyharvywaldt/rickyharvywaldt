Hello, World! I am Ricky ðŸ‘‹, and I currently work as project manager for PT PMA MadeIndonesia Outsourcing. Our office is located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia where a team of designers (UI/UX, graphic, and video editors), web developers, QA, and data entry specialists work on projects for IT Companies and end customers from all over the world. By no means do I identify myself as a web developer, but I really enjoy doing little web development projects âœ¨. So there you have it, my justification for being on GitHub.
